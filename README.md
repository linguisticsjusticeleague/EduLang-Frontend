## HOW TO PUSH CHANGES

---

**Make sure that you create seperate branches for your UI changes!**

- First, check periodically on the master branch to check any code updates using `git pull`
- Create a new branch on your local machine and switch: `git checkout -b [nameOfYourNewBranch]`
- Tip: You can see all the branches by using: `git branch -a`

- Check "git status" to see any changes
- To add all of your changes, do: "git add ."
- Then commit using `git commit -m "[descriptionOfChanges]"`
- Push your changes and branch to github (official cloud repository): `git push origin [nameOfYourNewBranch]`
- We then create a pull request after we people review your code, handles merge changes, approve it to the master branch :)

Don't feel hesistant to reach out to Eshaan, Jovani, Subha, or anyone else for help. :)
